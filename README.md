# Blog Samples
This code repository contains sample code for my msdn [blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mconnew/). There will be a focus on WCF and Performance related posts although from time to time I will discuss other issues. I'll provide a brief summary of each of the projects here while the list is still manageable to be so.

| Folder | Blog | Description |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- |
| [AsyncAuthentication](https://github.com/mconnew/BlogSamples/tree/master/src/AsyncAuthentication/) | [Link](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mconnew/2016/11/03/async-authentication-in-wcf/) |Starts request authentication in a custom validator and completes it in the operation dispatcher |

## Disclaimer
This is a sample for illustrating blog post topics. This is not production-ready code and hasn’t gone through the same rigorous testing that production code does. I try to write some basic tests and verify it works in those limited scenarios, but I cannot guarantee that it will work for all scenarios. If you use any of this code, you are responsible for your own testing and validation. Please let me know if you find a bug or something is missing by opening an issue. Even better, feel free to send a pull request with a fix. Also, for simplicity sake I don't generally tend to write a lot of error handling and logging which production-level code would need. In other words, use at your own risk.
