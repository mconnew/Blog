Hi, I am passionate about code-first Web Services, specifically WCF. 
I'm the main developer for WCF in the .NET Framework as well as the Core WCF client for .NET Core. 
I also am the main contributor to CoreWCF, a rebuilt version of WCF for .NET Core.

### More Information

As well as being more enthusiatic about WCF than is healthy, I have a wide range of hobbies I've picked up over the years.
I play a little guitar, I enjoy woodworking, electronics hobbies (embedded systems such as arduino), and love building Lego.
I also enjoy baking, cake decorating and have been known to knit and sew on the odd occasion. I am a year round motorcycle
rider (currently have a Yamaha Tracer 900 GT). I'm a full time single dad to two awesome girls.
